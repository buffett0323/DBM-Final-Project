# Guidelines by Buffett

1. Restore the data in Postgresql and name the database "hooper". Use the following link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S0cH1X19NJGFjrhi70FdptZv517Cluky/view?usp=share_link

2. After successfully loading the file, REMEMBER to change the table 'user' to 'users'!!! Very IMPORTANT!

3. Remember to create a new file called "db_password.txt" and place your password in it.

# Reminder
I currently ignore the graphic design. I will do that later.
